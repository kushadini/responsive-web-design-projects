            <p>Hello and Welcome to my page! My name is Kushadini Amali Mallawaarachchi and I am currently an international student studying at Conestoga College.
            <!-- I'm originally from Sri Lanka where I worked as a Web Production Manager for HSBC International Bank. My tenure at the bank goes up to 10+ years and I had the opportunity to work in several departments while I was working there. I started as a Client Due Diligence Analyst in the Banking Operations Department of the company, and then after working there for 6 years I finally made my career transition by joining my dream department, which is Digital Publishing Services where most of the company's corporate and other websites are handled. To tell you about my educational background, I completed my Primary and Higher education in a school in my hometown (Kiribathgoda) named Viharamahadevi Girls School. I started my career journey right after completing school and started and completed my undergraduate studies in the Information Technology field while I was working at my full-time job at HSBC. Although it was challenging, I somehow managed to balance both worlds and complete my studies successfully while adding significant work experience to my profile. -->
